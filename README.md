# Damn Tabs 2.0
A program I made to help writers who did not set up their indentation in there styles.

This is the second iteration of the tool I originally made for my partner who is a writer and didn't set up he indentation in the document, now it has **Damn Tabs**! (*hence the name*)

Uses the good old WinForms; written in C# using .NET 5 and [DocumentFormat.OpenXml](https://www.nuget.org/packages/DocumentFormat.OpenXml/2.12.1?_src=template)
