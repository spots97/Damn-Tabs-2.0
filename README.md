# Damn Tabs 2.0
A program I made to help writers who did not set up their indentation in their styles.

This is the second iteration of the tool I originally made for my partner who is a writer and didn't set up the indentation in the document, now it has **Damn Tabs**! (*hence the name*)

Uses the good old WinForms; written in C# using .NET 5 and DocumentFormat.OpenXml ([github](https://github.com/OfficeDev/Open-XML-SDK), [nuget](https://www.nuget.org/packages/DocumentFormat.OpenXml/))
